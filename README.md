# Project Euler

This repository contains my old (from 2014) and new project Euler solutions. I have converted some of the old C++ codes to Python3.



# Project Euler Solution Submissions

I use a short Python code (see [project_euler_stats.ipynb](https://github.com/sedihub/project_euler/blob/master/project_euler_stats.ipynb) notebook) to extract the latest solution statistics from the [website](https://projecteuler.net/archives) of Project Euler. Here is the plot of the statistics. Note that the y axis is in the log scale.
