# Project Euler

This repository contains my old (from 2014) and new [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) solutions. I may converted some of the old C++ codes to Python3.

I have deliberately refrained from using header files for certain common pieces (e.g., detecting primes) for two main reasons: I want the solutions to be standalone. The second reason is that this gives me the freedom to tweak them and use the most suitable version for the problem. 


# Project Euler Solution Submissions

I use a short Python code (see [project_euler_stats.ipynb](https://github.com/sedihub/project_euler/blob/master/project_euler_stats.ipynb) notebook) to extract the latest solution statistics from the [website](https://projecteuler.net/archives) of Project Euler. Here is the plot of the statistics. Note that the y axis is in the log scale.
